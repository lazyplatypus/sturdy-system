1. `git branch` to check which branch you're in
2. `git pull` to pull any updates from the remote (online) repository (repo)
3. `git checkout w1s1` if you're in main, move to w1s1 for week 1 step 1 with (or the name of the branch you were editing in)
3. `git add file1.md file2.js` to add the files you were editing (change names file1.md and file2.js)
	* `git add .` will add all the changed files including all new ones (use this when you edit or add multiple files to save time)
4. `git commit -m "[your-commit-message]"` change [your-commit-message] to specifically what changes you are committing
	* make sure there are no errors in this step
	* if there are errors and you're not sure how to proceed, reach out to an instructor on the [Bit Project Discord](join.bitproject.org)
5. `git push` to push all changes to the remote repo
