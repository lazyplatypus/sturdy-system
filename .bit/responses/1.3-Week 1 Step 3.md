### üåç Part 1: Hello, world

It's coding **tradition** for everyone's first program to be Hello, World. We will be creating a javascript function that will be printing hello world to the console. What does this mean? Let's try it!

- [ ] Create a new file:
	1. In the left menu bar that shows all the files in this directory, create a new file called week1/helloworld.js
		* Adding week1/ before the file name will create a new folder and place helloworld.js inside it
		* .js is the extension for javascript files
	2. Open the file you just made by double clicking it in the left menu
	3. Print "hello, world" to the screen
	4. Run the code using the `node helloworld.js` command in terminal

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	console.log("hello world");
</details>

- [ ] Create a new function:
	1. Create a function in the helloworld.js file that prints "hello, world" to the screen
	2.  Run the code using the `node helloworld.js` command in terminal

<details><summary>Peep my helloworld.js file:</summary>
	
	function hello() {
		console.log("hello world");
	}

	hello();
</details>
