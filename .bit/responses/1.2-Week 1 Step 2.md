## Week 1 Step 2

### Writing our first javascript function

### Git:

Once you have connected your GitHub to your local computer, run the following commands before starting:
<details><summary>1. In your main branch, pull any updates to your code. This is always good practice!</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

<details><summary>2. Delete your previous branches locally and remotely.</summary>
	
	git branch -d [previousBranchName]
	git push origin --delete [previousBranchName]
</details>

<details><summary>3. Change your branch to a new one for this step.</summary>
	
	git checkout -b w1s2
</details>

<details><summary>4. Pull code for this branch again just in case.</summary>
	
	git pull
</details>

### 💛 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to implement dynamic functions into webpages, often used with HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS deal with structure and styling, JavaScript allows webpages to handle managing more complex code and updating images, videos, animations, etc.

In this project, we will be create a JavaScript app that filters through some through tweets and uses sentiment analysis on the tweets to filter through and find only the positive ones #positivevibesonly

Note: since I (the developer of this Camp) am a massive ✨ BTS ✨ fan, I will be building the app tailored to the group and will be dropping a LOT of KPOP gifs along the way. Feel free to edit your code to reflect your own personal interests and style along the way 💜💜💜

### What is Node?

Since JavaScript is used in web development, we often need to have an HTML and CSS

Wouldn't it be great to be able to write and test JavaScript without having to build structure and style first? **Node.js** is an open source runtime environment that will allow us to run our code *outside of a web browser* (i.e. no need for HTML, CSS to run the code).

- [ ] Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer before proceeding.
