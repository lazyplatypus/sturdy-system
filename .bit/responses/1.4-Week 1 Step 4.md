### üëã Part 2: Hello, jungkook

- [ ] Now, let's complicate things a little. Instead of simply printing `hello, world` to the screen, let's create a second function that gets the user's name `user_name` from the command line arguments **and returns** a greeting saying `hello, [user_name]` where `user_name` is replaced by the provided input.

***Example input:***
```
node helloworld.js jungkook
```

You can test the output by printing the function's return value but make sure to remove the print statement when submitting your code.

***Example output:***
```
hello, jungkook
```

Don't move onwards until your code works.

1. `git branch` to check which branch you're in
2. `git pull` to pull any updates from the remote (online) repository (repo)
3. `git checkout w1s1` if you're in main, move to w1s1 for week 1 step 1 with (or the name of the branch you were editing in)
3. `git add file1.md file2.js` to add the files you were editing (change names file1.md and file2.js)
	* `git add .` will add all the changed files including all new ones (use this when you edit or add multiple files to save time)
4. `git commit -m "[your-commit-message]"` change [your-commit-message] to specifically what changes you are committing
	* make sure there are no errors in this step
	* if there are errors and you're not sure how to proceed, reach out to an instructor on the [Bit Project Discord](join.bitproject.org)
5. `git push` to push all changes to the remote repo
